Que 2: What are the Code Environments? and its Types.
Ans:
Code environment is a platform that consists of equipment that can be used for scripting codes, execution, developing, or testing the software. 
In simple words its a place where we can write and execute a code and check the output.

There are 3 types of code environments:
1)Text Editors: 
Here the programmer can write and modify the code only. These are general text editors.
e.g Visual Studio Code,Atom,etc.

2)Full IDE: Integrated Development Environment
All the essential tools are installed for automating the programmer's tasks like file management, selections, debug, integrations, and deployments.
e.g PyCharm, Spyder,etc.

3)Notebooks:
 In Jupyter Notebook we give input and get output of the code.
 We can download files as .py .
